# Description
This adds the new mods to the modconfig.xml on game load instead when you open the workshop menu, so you do not have to go to the workshop menu to get mods to work or load since the modconfig.xml was 
only updated when you opened the workshop menu

## Requires
This requires https://github.com/ihatetn931/StationeersBepinExModLoader <br>
This will prolly eventually be a workshop mod as well. <br>
I might make a standalone version if anyone wants it.

## Install
Just copy this dll in to your BepinEx/plugins folder
